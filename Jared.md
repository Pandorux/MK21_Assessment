# Things to Consider
- Instead of doing null checks, do exception handling
- Should I really be using StopWatch for time tracking?
    - My solution for StopWatch and Countdown need to be the same for consistent behavior 
- How am I going to validate time inputs? 
    - Regex is always a nice option
# TimeMode Interface Methods
    - StartTimeMode
    - ResetTimeMode
    - StopTimeMode
